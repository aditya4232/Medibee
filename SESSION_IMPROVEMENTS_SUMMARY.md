# Session Management and Website Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the MediBee application's session management system and website navigation to ensure proper redirects and user experience.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced ProtectedRoute Component
**File**: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- Added `redirectToHome` prop to control redirect behavior
- Enhanced session checking with better loading states
- Added proper session prompt UI with action buttons
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added automatic redirect to homepage for session start

**Features**:
- Configurable redirect behavior
- Beautiful session prompt UI with glass morphism design
- Clear call-to-action buttons for session start
- Consistent loading states across the application

### 2. Updated App.tsx Routing
**File**: `src/App.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Applied `ProtectedRoute` to all pages except homepage
- Dashboard, Analysis, and Reports now require active sessions
- Privacy Policy and 404 pages allow access without sessions
- Consistent protection across all routes

**Route Protection**:
```typescript
// Protected routes (require session)
/dashboard - redirects to home if no session
/analysis - redirects to home if no session  
/reports - redirects to home if no session

// Public routes (no session required)
/ - homepage (always accessible)
/privacy - accessible without session
/* - 404 page accessible without session
```

### 3. Enhanced SessionProvider
**File**: `src/components/SessionProvider.tsx`

**New Features**:
- Auto-redirect logic for protected pages
- Improved session tracking and page visit monitoring
- Better session expiration handling
- Enhanced error handling and recovery

**Auto-redirect Logic**:
- Users on protected paths without sessions are automatically redirected to homepage
- Session popup is triggered after redirect
- Seamless user experience with proper state management

### 4. Updated Individual Pages

#### Dashboard Page (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Added `SessionIndicator` component
- Removed manual session checks (handled by ProtectedRoute)
- Improved user experience with session-aware content

#### Analysis Page (`src/pages/Analysis.tsx`)
- Added `SessionIndicator` component
- Removed manual session handling
- Clean, session-protected interface

#### Reports Page (`src/pages/Reports.tsx`)

- Removed manual session check logic
- Streamlined user interface

#### Index Page (`src/pages/Index.tsx`)

- Enhanced CTA buttons with proper session handling
- Improved user flow for session start and dashboard navigation

### 5. New Custom Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useSessionRedirect.ts`

**Purpose**: Reusable session redirect logic for future components

**Features**:
- `useSessionRedirect` - General purpose session redirect hook

- User-friendly error states

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Code Organization
